### What is a nonogram?

A nonogram is a simple logic puzzle where the player must determine which squares on a grid must remain empty and which must be filled. The effect, in the end, is to reproduce a monochromatic pixelized image.

Here's an example of a puzzle being solved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#/media/File:Paint_by_numbers_Animation.gif):
